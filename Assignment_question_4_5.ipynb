       " \"a a native bhutanese i 'd like to say that we do have our flaw . poverty is a problem in some part of the country , nepotism and corruption do exist . teen do commit sucide due to depression , and all of the vice that is almost immisible with the very nature of humanity do exist here , but to a lesser extent . partly because we have a smaller population so there is le struggle for resource ( a bit of darwinism here ) and hence a smaller crime rate . there is also a lack of `` organized crime '' in bhutan . though you may hear of bhutanese smuggler caught smuggling this thing or that in certain airport ( usually india , bangkok , etc ) , the `` smuggler '' themselves are often paid by some organiser and and are n't a part of some criminal organisation based in bhutan . we did have some gang ( mb boy being the most notorious ) before .. like in the 2010s but the police seem to have done a good job in dismantling them . corruption and nepotism do exist but it doe n't exist in a sustainable manner like in some country ( india , nepal , bangladesh to name a few ) partly because most of these perpetrator are greedy opportunist who lack much foresight and partly becaus the agency that we have to counter such crimmes are quite efficient and do not let such criminal blight to take root in the system . _x000d_ _x000d_ _x000d_ most of the crime that occur are to do with some form of violence ( the bhutanese are quite hot headed at time ... specially those from the west , and alcohol flow quite freely in our vein ) or petty thievery . violence against woman is an issue , specially in the rural area and thing do seems to be getting better but there is still a lot left to do . a for the lgbtq .... there are only a handful of them and there is n't much discrimination against them ... sure they 'll raise a few eyebrow wherever they go but this is because there are so few of them ( most stay somewhere near the capital where thing are a bit `` westernized '' / '' globalized '' and with that come the `` western '' `` liberal '' view of sexuality . ) in short , sexuality is n't much of an issue with most bhutanese so we do n't bother much with who doe what with whom . you may find mural of holy protective penis on wall but these mural have le of a sexual connotation , and more of a symbolic one . ( there is also a bit of tantric influence here ) _x000d_ _x000d_ a for our monarch , we are very lucky to have them and i mean this honestly . i do concede that it is n't entirely untrue to say that there is a bit of `` propaganda '' ( in a very loose sense of that word ) to paint the royal in a good light , but i think this is justifiable because : firstly , people on average are n't very bright and often lack coherence ( look at the current state of most `` true '' democracy in the world if you do n't believe me ) so in the long run they may lack forsight , and often cause a distruption to the flow of progress due to civil unrest ( you may argue that such `` disruption '' due to civil unrest are n't a bad a i believe them to be and are infact quite necessary , this may be true for other country , but for a tiny country like bhutan lodged between two giant and sly nation , any form of civil unrest must be avoided or properly diffused in order to protect our sovereignty ) so i believe a `` propaganda '' is required to unify the opinion of the `` mass '' on certain topic . the intellectual minority that do exist ( here a they do elsewhere ) , would , i believe , opt not to act greedily for their own benefit and harm the nation , a they will be under scrutiny of the royal ( who have the support of the public ) . the royal are n't all powerful though , they may have influence over the mass opinion on certain topic but the are limited in their power by the constitution , the king may be the head of the state ( and decide who to grant citizenship to ) but the government ( both local and centralized ) are democratically elected and controlled most matter . it 's similar to what they have in uk but the people like the royal a bit more ( so they have more influence ) , and our house of lord ( called the national council ) is n't filled with aristocrat . _x000d_ _x000d_ secondly , i say that we are lucky to have such royal because that is true . had they been the wrong sort of royal , the public would n't have liked them . it doe seem a bit sad to think that people in other country ( who might have been so cheated by their own royal ) find it so difficult to believe in the existence of a genuinely good king , who doe care about his people and country . the royal serve another purpose too , they provide the mass with moral support specially in time of crisis ( such a this ) . it is for these reason that i feel the `` saccharine propaganda '' ( if you could even call it that ) of the royal is justified . looking at the state that our country is in currently ( compared to our neighbour who are in quite a pinch due to the ongoing pandemic ) i think you 'll find that the public is n't wrong to appreciate such royals._x000d_ _x000d_ a for racism , yes it doe exist here too like it doe everywhere . infact it 's existence is expected given the faliablities of humanity and the presence of two clearly distinct ethnic group ( the ethnic caucasoid and ethnic mongoloid ) with visibly ( but not symbolic ... more on this later ) different religion/culture . but it is n't currently doing the country much harm . and effort are being made to homogenized the two . it 's usually the rural area wher most racist thought prevail , since these community are usually made up of people of a single ethnicity hence they are more prone to think in term of u and them . even within these two distinct group there is a bit of discrimination based on class and caste but these issue stay within lounge over cup of tea or a glass of wine or around the fireplace after a good day work . people do believe in stereotype but this doe n't cause anyone much trouble since publically acting out on these racist thought would bring the public 's attention to the perpetrator and they 'll be punished for acting out . this is because we bhutanese have a strong sense of morality when judging others ( or atleast some vocal bhutanese do ) and so racism is prevented from being institutionalized . _x000d_ _x000d_ another aspect of bhutanese culture that might seem peculiar to others is how happy we `` claim '' we are . it is true that bhutan is a peaceful country , we are n't at war with anyone , people are well taken care of , healthcare and education are free ( * ahem * * ahem * 'murica * ahem * ) . these and a lot more are what you 're general told but i 'd like to point out a few other reason for our happiness . firstly , both the major religion that you may find in bhutan ( vajrayana `` buddhism '' and `` hinduism '' ) are rather philosophical in practice , and their philosophy is one of non-violence , anti-materialism ( you wo n't find any hindu who follows the philosophy of lokayata here ) and one that is centred around finding hapiness . not all bhutanese are religious but the moral value that these two religion emphasizes do seem to trickle down and take root in the mind of most bhutanese . on this note , the current king ha taken initiative to preserve both of these religion and he seems to be quite a devotee of shiva ( shaivism share a lot of similarity in it 's philosophy with the form of tantric buddhism practiced in bhutan ) . another reason that the bhutanese are so happy is because of their simplicity in thought and their innocence . sure there are a few sly fox and snake but they do not seem to be able to induce their shrewdness onto other bhutanese . life is le stressful here so people have n't the need to burn themselves down to the last shreads of humanity , to struggle , to deceive others for their survival . some may find the bhutanese speech to be one that is quite slow , this may be the product of a sedated life since life is quite stress free here compare to elsewhere , but this is a generalisation and there will always be a few exception . we are a merry lot , because most of u have n't seen the true depravity of humanity . _x000d_ _x000d_ and the reason that you were taken outside the city centre might be because it 's the agenda of the tourism board to mesmarize you with the beautiful landscape and peculiar culture . sure they could let you vist the city ( if you could call them that ) but it 's not there that we have the best to offer and there 's also the danger of `` certain '' tourist `` spoiling '' the urban youth ( drug , sex tourism ... the like ) so one ha to act cautiously . besides that , the tourism board might have wanted to be more hospitable and pamper you by relieving you of some of the decision and choosing thing for you so that you could better enjoy the experience ( here you see a misunderstanding between two culture ) . on that note , any sort of tourism would have to put up a façade , an idea of what they are trying to sell , reality is far to complex to fit into such neat descriptions._x000d_ _x000d_ bhutan is n't the happiest place ( idk how you 'd even measure happiness ) but the condition that should keep a person happy are well fulfilled here .\",\n",

       " 'so , i ’ m not bhutanese , so this may have hole that i would welcome other people to fill in . i studied abroad in bhutan and also lived in an area of the u with a large bhutanese refugee population._x000d_ _x000d_ in the early 1900s i think , unrest in nepal led to many refugee fleeing and settling in bhutan , eventually integrating into community . they were bhutanese , most only spoke dzongkha and sometimes english like most bhutanese , but kept many of their cultural and religious custom from nepal , where hindu and buddhism blend for most family . this included cultural dress and religious holidays._x000d_ _x000d_ in the ninety , a bhutan began to modernize and step into the global stage , government became increasingly concerned about their national identity . their relationship to china ha obviously been contentious since the tibetan genocide , and other small country in the region like sikkim , nepal , are in cycle of unrest or in sikkim ’ s case annexed . bhutan ’ s perspective wa that preservation of a firm , consistent , and unique national identity would bolster their value on the world ’ s stage and prevent overthrow , invasion , etc . among the law they passed to ensure this were thing like the national dress law , which required bhutanese to wear traditional clothing in lot of different contexts—i think at school and work and on holiday especially , but also it might still be a law that any piece of medium that get internationally distributed that depicts bhutanese life requires all participant to be in national dress._x000d_ _x000d_ this conflicted with the religious and cultural custom of the once-nepalese population in the south of bhutan and thing became very contentious very quickly . anecdotally , there were horrific atrocity taking place—beheadings and murder of activist and brutal response to the non-bhutanese cultural dress . beyond the earth and sky by jaime zappa go into it a little bit—she wa in the country for some of the activity . the somewhat tepid reasoning i wa given when gently asking about this—not while i wa in the country—was that the bhutanese government didn ’ t want nepal to be able to make a cultural claim to bhutanese soil , a india did to sikkim . ( go figure , they failed to mention that sikkim went through a whole overview—it wa presented to me a “ they were absorbed for failure to have a national identity distinct from india , ” which isn ’ t quite true ) . _x000d_ _x000d_ the bloodiness of this conflict , almost entirely perpetrated on the nepalese descended bhutanese , escalated , attracted some attention on the world stage , and the government cut their loss and expelled every last one from the country . people who had lived almost a hundred year peacefully alongside ethnic bhutanese , who knew of no other home , were forced out . many settled in cleveland , where i lived a while , and are still struggling immensely to find financial support , integrate and understand american custom and english , etc . their community are wracked with poverty and obviously the terror and violence they endured before being expelled from bhutan is still very much living memory._x000d_ _x000d_ i loved my time in bhutan and i think it ’ s a marvelous country—certainly a an american i can ’ t throw stone . but it would be a mistake to award the minister who made most of the decision and perpetuated this violence—essentially erasing an entire hybrid culture and a chapter of bhutanese history—with any sort of esteem . in time , i truly hope bhutan ’ s position on all of this will become apologetic and with an eye toward reparations—the bhutanese diaspora still need them . they certainly have a different rhetorical approach to tibetan refugee . i have hope , but not when the country allows this event to be glorified._x000d_ _x000d_ edit - did some reading that might help your googling . the expelled group are called the lhotshampa , and their exile took place from the late eighty to 1993 . something like 100,000 were forced out , which is like a sixth or a seventh of bhutan ’ s total population . i wa also wrong above ; many of the lhotshampa knew no dzongkha , only nepali and english , and one measure the government took wa to remove nepali a a language of instruction .',\n",
       " \"i will try to make it short . the so called refugee were nepalese who fled nepal due to the political instability occurring in the country at the time or simply wanted to move to another nation ( bhutan , india & so on ) . when they arrived in bhutan , they were allowed to do so provided they abide by the local law & tradition . however the geo political climate at the time saw many tibetan-burman kingdom falling to either india ( ladakh & sikkim ) or to china ( tibet ) . sikkim in particular is an important case a the royal family of sikkim & bhutan are cousin . a part of india 's strategy to annex sikkim , a large percentage of nepalese & indian who having settled in the country removed the chogyal of sikkim & the royal family from power . the native sikkimese were reduced to becoming a minority in their own nation . bhutan having witnessed this , refused to suffer the same fate . the royal govt of bhutan came up with the plan to unify it ppl so that no foreign agent could ever topple bhutan . unfortunately the nepalese did not see that way despite being reassured that it would not take away their cultural heritage or identity . some ( possibly more ) of the nepalese incited doubt & fear among their countryman which resulted in nepalese asking for a new land within bhutan just a bhutan feared . any nepalese who refused to go along with this madness were deemed a traitor by other nepalese & killed or harmed . while it is true that bhutan did resort to using armed force to quell the problem , this wa only done after failing to come to a peaceful solution with the nepalese & there were strict order to not harm the nepalese ( after all some of them held high post in royal govt ) . when all else failed , majority of the nepalese decided ( not expelled ) to get out of bhutan despite plea from the nation not to do so . those who remained became the current lhotshampas . while it is true that bhutan could have handled thing in a better way , the nepalese gave little choice to for a proper solution . these `` refugee '' like telling outsider their sob story but they always conveniently omitt having their hand in causing their own problem or the real reason of leaving bhutan . the lhotshampas living in bhutan are given equal opportunity & treatment a any other bhutanese ethnic group and for those wondering lhotshampas is the correct political term for bhutanese citizen of nepalese heritage . the so called `` refugee '' are nepalese plain & simple . being able to speak dzongkha doe not make you a bhutanese otherwise anyone who can speak japanese or english is automatically by that logic a british or a japanese citizen .\",\n",
